	<p>This is my first paragraph for some css style builders. My name is Jordan and I am a sophmore. I am from Seattle and I went to Bishop Blanchet High School, now at UW studying businenss. I am not currently in the business school but I will be applying in the spring and hoping to focus in finance. I am also hoping to minor in informatics or get my sales certificate.</p>
	<p2>In high school I did lots of different activities. I ran cross country my freshman year, wrestled, and played soccer. My next three years I played golf, wrestling, and soccer. I also love to ski in the winter and do any activities in the snow. At UW, I am in the finance club and the husky hydrofoil club. I am in a fraternity as well and love spending time out side.</p2>
